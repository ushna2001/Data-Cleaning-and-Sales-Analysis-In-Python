# Data-Cleaning-and-Sales-Analysis-In-Python
Overview

This project involves cleaning and analyzing a sales dataset using Python. The primary goal was to extract meaningful insights from the data by performing data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. The analysis focused on understanding customer demographics and their purchasing behavior across different categories.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains sales records, including customer demographics such as age, gender, occupation, and marital status, along with product details and sales amounts.

Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning

Imported Data: Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
Dropped Unnecessary Columns: Removed irrelevant or blank columns to streamline the dataset.
Handled Missing Values: Dropped rows with missing values to ensure data integrity.
Data Type Conversion: Changed data types of specific columns to appropriate formats for analysis.

2. Data Exploration
   
Descriptive Statistics: Used the describe() method to generate summary statistics for numerical columns.
Column Renaming: Renamed columns for better clarity.

3. Data Visualization
   
Gender Analysis: Created bar charts to visualize the distribution of sales amount by gender.
Age Group Analysis: Analyzed the total sales amount across different age groups.
Marital Status and Gender: Explored sales data by marital status and gender, using bar charts.
Occupation Analysis: Visualized sales distribution across different occupations.
Product Category Analysis: Identified the top-selling product categories and visualized them.
Product ID Analysis: Highlighted the top 10 most sold products using bar charts.

Key Insights

Target Audience: Married women aged between 26 to 35 years old working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation are more likely to purchase products from food, clothing, and electronics categories.
Product Popularity: Certain product categories and specific products emerged as top-sellers, indicating potential areas for strategic focus in marketing and inventory management.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of Python for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. The insights gained from the analysis can help in understanding customer behavior and making data-driven decisions for improving sales strategies.
